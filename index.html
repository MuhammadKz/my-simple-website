        <h3>My First Blog</h3>
        <p>Hey there! Thanks for stopping by! Im thrilled to welcome you to my little corner of the internet â€” a simple website built with curiosity, creativity, and a desire to learn and grow.This site is still a work in progress (isn't everything?), but its where Ill be sharing updates, thoughts, small projects, and anything else that catches my attention. Whether you're here by accident or on purpose, I hope you find something useful, interesting, or at least mildly entertaining.
        Why I Built This Site </p>

        <h3>My Second Blog</h3>
       <p> I wanted a space that was mine. Social media is great, but its loud and messy. This website is quiet and personal â€” a place where I can experiment, write freely, and maybe even break things (on purpose, of course).
        More importantly, I wanted to learn by doing. From writing basic HTML and CSS to experimenting with blogs, links, and styling, every part of this site is a small lesson in progress. It might not be flashy, but it's real â€” and thats enough for me.</p>

        Blog posts like this one â€” short and simple reflections on what Im working on or learning.
        Projects â€” anything I build, whether its a mini app, a design experiment, or just a fun idea.
        Random thoughts â€” because sometimes, its nice to just write things down. </p>
